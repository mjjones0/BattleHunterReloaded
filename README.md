# BattleHunterReloaded
Battle Hunter was a multiplayer party tactics role-playing game for PS1. It had a great idea, but mediocre execution. This project is a work to improve on the concept. It likely won't be Battle Hunter itself but something maybe similar but vastly improved from a game design perspective.
